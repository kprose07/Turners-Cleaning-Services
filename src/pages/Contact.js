        <p id='subtc'>Greetings,</p>
        <p>With much enthusiasm and sincerity, I would like to say thank you taking the time to consider Turner's
Cleaning Service as an option for your janitorial needs. I hope you found as much joy in reviewing this portfolio
as I did during each experience. Assisting others with presenting a pristine and professional image has long
been a passion of mine. I learned early the value of comfort and relief one feels after having a freshly cleaned
and organized space. From the home of hard-working parents and sharing rooms with several siblings to my
experience in the U.S. Navy on the shorelines our Coastal waters, I have strong foundation in three key
principals I have implemented into Turner's Cleaning Service: Respect; Professionalism; and Quality. Those
principals drive my business as well as my personal endeavors; therefore, that it my promise to you both
personally and professionally.</p>
